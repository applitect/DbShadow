== Description
Have you ever had the need to copy data from one database to another? How about between to different types of
databases? How about just verifying that your database tables between replicated instances are in sync?

DbShadow is a Java command line application that can help you perform these actions. Using the power of JDBC, it
can read data from one database instance and then using primary keys compare, propogate, and locate differences within
a separate database instance.
